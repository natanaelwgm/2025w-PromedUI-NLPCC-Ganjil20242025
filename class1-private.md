# Class 1: Introduction to Computing & the Cloud

**(Goal: Understand computing fundamentals and how cloud platforms enable NLP in media production.)**

## I. Introduction & Course Framing

* **A. Welcome & Setting the Stage:** NLP for Media in the Cloud
* **B. Why NLP Matters for Media:** From Transcription to Generative Content
* **C. The Challenge of Media NLP:** Data Volume, Format Variety, Scale
* **D. The Cloud's Role:** Providing Infrastructure & Services for Media NLP
* **E. Our Course Approach:** Learning NLP Concepts, Applying with Cloud Tools

## II. Computing Fundamentals in Plain English

* **A. Compute:** What happens when you process language
* **B. Storage:** Where your media files and NLP results live
* **C. Network:** How data moves between systems and users
* **D. Activity:** Mapping a transcription job to compute, storage, and network components

## III. Cloud Models for Media NLP

* **A. SaaS:** Ready-to-use NLP web APIs (transcription, translation, etc.)
* **B. PaaS:** Managed platforms for building NLP pipelines
* **C. Serverless:** Event-driven functions for NLP tasks
* **D. Trade-offs:** Control vs. Convenience, Cost vs. Capability

## IV. Media NLP in Action: Real-World Use Cases

* **A. Use Case 1:** Auto-Transcription (Speech-to-Text)
* **B. Use Case 2:** Bulk Subtitle Translation
* **C. Use Case 3:** Sentiment Tracking on Social Campaigns
* **D. Connecting Use Cases to Cloud Needs:** Why cloud makes these feasible (Scalability, Pre-trained Models/APIs, Data Storage)

## V. Live Demonstration: Cloud-Based NLP in Action

* **A. Task:** Cloud Speech-to-Text Service (e.g., via Web Console or simple API call)
* **B. Steps & Observation Points** (Input audio -> Processing -> Output text)
* **C. Connecting Demo to Concepts:** Identifying the NLP Task (STT) & the enabling Cloud elements

## VI. Activity: Mapping Your Workflow to Cloud Resources

* **A. Task:** "Which parts of your workflow could live in compute, storage, or network?"
* **B. Process:**
    * 1. Identify media tasks involving language/text/speech
    * 2. Map each to appropriate cloud resources
    * 3. Consider scale, performance, and cost factors
* **C. Discussion & Q&A**
