# Natural Language Processing and Cloud Computing (NLP CC)

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing and Cloud Computing course at Vokasi Produksi Media Universitas Indonesia! This practical course combines foundational NLP concepts with cloud-based tools to solve real media production challenges.

## Course Information

This course is offered by the Program Vokasi Produksi Media Universitas Indonesia in the Odd semester of 2024/2025, specifically designed for Human Computer Interaction and Media Intelligence students. The course explores how media professionals can leverage NLP and cloud technologies to enhance media production workflows.

## Instructor

**Natanael Waraney Gerald Massie** is an economist at Prospera with expertise in data analysis, economic research, and computer science. With a Master's in Computer and Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor's in Economics from the University of Indonesia, he brings a multidisciplinary approach to computational methods in media applications.

His background includes data analysis for sub-national budgets, economic modeling, and research on emerging sectors and industrial policy, all of which inform the practical computational techniques taught in this course.
