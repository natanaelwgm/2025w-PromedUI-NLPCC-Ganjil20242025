# Course Scoring Rubric

This course uses a flexible scoring system designed to reward engagement and public sharing of work. The standard assessment path allows you to earn up to 100 points, while optional activities provide opportunities to earn up to 45 additional points (theoretical maximum: 145 points).

## Scoring Components

### 1. Participation (20-25 points)

**Base: 20 points**
* Calculated based on attendance across all 6 class sessions
* Points are prorated based on the amount of time spent in each class session
* Each full session attended earns approximately 3.33 points

**Bonus: Up to 5 additional points**
* Keep your camera ON during class sessions
* Points are prorated based on the proportion of time your camera is on
* Example: If class is 90 minutes and your camera is on for 60 minutes, you earn 2/3 of the possible camera-on points for that session
* Full camera-on attendance for all sessions = maximum 25 points

**Examples:**
* **Scenario 1:** Student attends all 6 sessions fully = 20 points. Camera on 100% of the time = 5 bonus points. Total: 25 points.
* **Scenario 2:** Student attends 5 full sessions (16.67 points) and 50% of the 6th session (1.67 points) = 18.34 points. Camera on for 4 full sessions (3.33 points) = Total: 21.67 points.
* **Scenario 3:** Student attends 4 full sessions but misses 2 sessions completely = 13.33 points. Camera on 75% of the time during those 4 sessions (2.5 points) = Total: 15.83 points.
* **Scenario 4:** Student attends all sessions but joins 15 minutes late to each 90-minute class (83% attendance) = 16.67 points. Camera on during all attended time = 4.17 bonus points. Total: 20.84 points.

### 2. Weekly Tasks (60-90 points)

**Base: 60 points total (10 points per week)**
* Complete weekly hands-on tasks related to class content
* Private submissions earn up to 10 points each based on quality and completeness

**Bonus: 1.5× multiplier per task**
* Make your weekly submissions PUBLIC (blog, GitHub, etc.)
* Example: A 10-point private submission becomes 15 points when shared publicly
* Maximum potential: 90 points (15 points × 6 weeks)

**Examples:**
* **Scenario 1:** Student completes all 6 weekly tasks privately with excellent quality (10/10 for each) = 60 points.
* **Scenario 2:** Student completes 5 private tasks (8/10 quality for each = 40 points) and makes 1 submission public (7/10 quality × 1.5 = 10.5 points) = 50.5 points.
* **Scenario 3:** Student completes 4 private tasks (9/10 quality for each = 36 points) and shares 2 tasks publicly (10/10 quality × 1.5 for each = 30 points) = 66 points.
* **Scenario 4:** Student publicly shares all 6 weekly tasks with varying quality (7/10, 8/10, 10/10, 9/10, 10/10, 8/10) = (7+8+10+9+10+8) × 1.5 = 78 points.

### 3. Final Project (20-30 points)

**Base: 20 points**
* Create a comprehensive project applying multiple course concepts
* Private submission earns up to 20 points based on quality and requirements

**Bonus: 1.5× multiplier**
* Make your final project PUBLIC (live demo, public repository, detailed blog)
* Example: A 20-point private project becomes 30 points when shared publicly

**Examples:**
* **Scenario 1:** Student submits a private final project meeting all requirements with excellent quality = 20 points.
* **Scenario 2:** Student creates a public project with good quality (17/20) and includes a live demo = 17 × 1.5 = 25.5 points.
* **Scenario 3:** Student develops an exceptional public project that exceeds requirements, with detailed documentation and a public repository = 20 × 1.5 = 30 points.
* **Scenario 4:** Student submits a private project with satisfactory quality (15/20) = 15 points.

## Grading Philosophy

Our flexible scoring system is designed to:

1. **Provide multiple paths to success** - You can achieve a standard "A" (100%) through private submissions with excellent quality
2. **Reward engagement** - Camera usage enhances class interaction and community
3. **Build your portfolio** - Public sharing of work helps build your professional presence
4. **Accommodate different comfort levels** - Choose whether to keep submissions private or make them public

The bonus opportunities are intentionally substantial to encourage sharing knowledge with the broader community while respecting that some students may prefer to keep their work private.

## Final Grade Calculation

While you can earn up to 145 points, final letter grades will be calculated based on these thresholds:

* **A**: 90-100+ points
* **B**: 80-89 points
* **C**: 70-79 points
* **D**: 60-69 points
* **F**: Below 60 points

**Note:** Points earned beyond 100 will be noted as "bonus points" on your transcript but don't change the maximum grade of A.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Why is camera usage encouraged and rewarded?

We encourage camera usage because this course is designed as an interactive learning community. When everyone dedicates their time to being fully present, the entire class benefits. 

The camera-on points reflect our appreciation for students who fully commit their time and attention to our shared learning experience. This course includes many code-along sessions and hands-on exercises, and being visibly present helps create an engaged atmosphere.

It's completely understandable that you may have reasons to keep your camera off at times. That's why our scoring system is flexible - you can still achieve an excellent grade by excelling in other components even if you prefer not to use your camera.

### 2. What counts as "public sharing" for the weekly tasks and final project?

Public sharing means making your work accessible outside the classroom in a professional format. This could include:
* A public GitHub repository with proper documentation
* A blog post explaining your approach and code
* A publicly accessible demo or website
* A presentation video shared on platforms like YouTube

The key is that others outside our class can learn from and engage with your work.

### 3. Can I still get an A without attending all classes?

Absolutely! The scoring system is intentionally flexible. For example:
* If you attend no classes (0/20 points) but complete all weekly tasks privately with excellence (60 points) and create an exceptional public final project (30 points), you would earn 90 points - enough for an A.
* You can mix and match how you earn points based on your strengths and preferences.

### 4. What if I have technical issues during a class session?

Technical difficulties happen. If you experience camera issues, internet problems, or other technical challenges:
* Document the issue when it occurs
* Communicate with the instructor as soon as possible
* We'll work with you to ensure you aren't unfairly penalized for technical problems outside your control

### 5. How detailed do my weekly submissions need to be?

Weekly submissions are evaluated based on:
* Correct implementation of the required functionality
* Code quality and organization
* Thoroughness in addressing the assignment requirements
* Creativity and effort beyond the minimum requirements

Higher scores are awarded to submissions that demonstrate mastery of the concepts and attention to detail.

### 6. What makes a final project "excellent" versus "satisfactory"?

An excellent final project typically:
* Applies multiple course concepts correctly and creatively
* Demonstrates technical proficiency and attention to detail
* Includes thorough documentation
* Shows originality and practical application
* Functions as intended without significant bugs or issues

A satisfactory project meets the basic requirements but may lack the polish, complexity, or creativity of an excellent submission.

### 7. Are late submissions accepted?

We understand that unexpected circumstances arise. Please communicate with the instructor as early as possible about potential late submissions. In general:
* Late submissions may be accepted with appropriate communication
* Extremely late work or submissions without prior notice may receive reduced points
* Consistent patterns of late work may impact your ability to earn full points

### 8. How do I submit my work?

Detailed submission instructions will be provided for each assignment. Typically:
* Private submissions will be through the course learning management system
* Public submissions should include a link to your public work (repository, blog, etc.)
* Always follow the specific submission guidelines for each assignment
