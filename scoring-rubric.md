# Course Scoring Rubric

This course uses a flexible scoring system designed to reward engagement and public sharing of work. The standard assessment path allows you to earn up to 100 points, while optional activities provide opportunities to earn up to 50 additional points (theoretical maximum: 150 points).

## Scoring Components

### 1. Participation (10-15 points)

**Base: 10 points**
* Calculated based on attendance across all 6 class sessions
* Each session attended earns approximately 1.67 points

**Bonus: Up to 5 additional points**
* Keep your camera ON during entire class sessions
* Full camera-on attendance for all sessions = maximum 15 points

### 2. Weekly Tasks (60-90 points)

**Base: 60 points total (10 points per week)**
* Complete weekly hands-on tasks related to class content
* Private submissions earn up to 10 points each based on quality and completeness

**Bonus: 1.5× multiplier per task**
* Make your weekly submissions PUBLIC (blog, GitHub, etc.)
* Example: A 10-point private submission becomes 15 points when shared publicly
* Maximum potential: 90 points (15 points × 6 weeks)

### 3. Final Project (30-45 points)

**Base: 30 points**
* Create a comprehensive project applying multiple course concepts
* Private submission earns up to 30 points based on quality and requirements

**Bonus: 1.5× multiplier**
* Make your final project PUBLIC (live demo, public repository, detailed blog)
* Example: A 30-point private project becomes 45 points when shared publicly

## Summary Table

| Component | Base Points | Optional Bonus | Maximum Points | % of Standard Grade |
|:----------|:------------|:---------------|:---------------|:--------------------|
| **Participation** | 10 | Camera on (+5) | 15 | 10% |
| **Weekly Tasks** | 60 (10×6) | Public sharing (1.5×) | 90 (15×6) | 60% |
| **Final Project** | 30 | Public sharing (1.5×) | 45 | 30% |
| **TOTAL** | **100** | **+50** | **150** | **100%** |

## Grading Philosophy

Our flexible scoring system is designed to:

1. **Provide multiple paths to success** - You can achieve a standard "A" (100%) through private submissions with excellent quality
2. **Reward engagement** - Camera usage enhances class interaction and community
3. **Build your portfolio** - Public sharing of work helps build your professional presence
4. **Accommodate different comfort levels** - Choose whether to keep submissions private or make them public

The bonus opportunities are intentionally substantial to encourage sharing knowledge with the broader community while respecting that some students may prefer to keep their work private.

## Final Grade Calculation

While you can earn up to 150 points, final letter grades will be calculated based on these thresholds:

* **A**: 90-100+ points
* **B**: 80-89 points
* **C**: 70-79 points
* **D**: 60-69 points
* **F**: Below 60 points

**Note:** Points earned beyond 100 will be noted as "bonus points" on your transcript but don't change the maximum grade of A.
