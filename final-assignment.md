# Final Project: The NLP Innovator's Pitch!

Alright everyone, we've journeyed through the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing, explored powerful cloud tools, and seen how these technologies can revolutionize various industries and solve real-world problems. Now, it's time to bring it all together for your **Final Project!**

This is your chance to think like an entrepreneur, a product manager, and an innovator. You'll be conceptualizing and pitching a product, feature, or application that leverages NLP (and potentially cloud tools) to solve a real problem or create a new opportunity in any domain that interests you.

## The Goal

Your mission is to design and pitch an innovative solution that showcases your understanding of NLP concepts and their practical application to solve real-world problems. Think big, be creative, and demonstrate how NLP technology can reshape how people work, communicate, learn, or live.

## Deliverables

For this final project, your group will need to submit **two key items**:

1.  **The Pitch Deck:** A concise, visually compelling presentation (e.g., Google Slides, PowerPoint, exported to PDF for submission) that outlines your idea.
2.  **The Pitch Presentation (Recorded):** A 10-15 minute video recording of your group presenting the pitch deck. Imagine you're pitching to stakeholders who could bring your idea to life!

*(We are not requiring a separate detailed supporting document for this submission, but ensure your deck and presentation are comprehensive.)*

## Group Formation - Collaboration is Key!

This is a **GROUP assignment**. Given our class composition, we want to foster collaboration between different specializations.

*   **Group Size:** We will have **two groups** in total.
*   **Composition Requirement:** Each group **MUST** consist of:
    *   At least one (1) student from the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** specialization.
    *   At least one (1) student from the **Media Intelligence (MI)** specialization.
*   **Reporting Your Group:**
    *   Decide on your groups and designate one person to email me (`natanael.waraney@ui.ac.id` AND `natanaelmassie2009@gmail.com`) with the group members.
    *   **Deadline for Reporting Groups:** **Wednesday, May 28th, 2025, 23:55 WIB.**
    *   **Penalty:** Failure to report your group by this deadline will result in a **-10 point deduction** from your final project score for *each member* of the late-reported or unassigned group.

## The Pitch: Core Components & Checklist

Your pitch deck and presentation must cover the following components. Think of this as a checklist. Each item *must be addressed*. While you don't need one slide per sub-item, ensure every point is thoughtfully covered. Major sections (I, II, III, etc.) will naturally span multiple slides.

### **High-Level Pitch Structure:**

*   **I. The Hook & The Big Idea** (Checklist Items 1.1 - 1.3)
*   **II. The Problem & The Opportunity** (Checklist Items 2.1 - 2.4)
*   **III. Your Solution** (Checklist Items 3.1 - 3.6)
*   **IV. Impact & Feasibility** (Checklist Items 4.1 - 4.3)
*   **V. The "Why" & Next Steps** (Checklist Items 5.1 - 5.4)

### **Detailed Pitch Checklist & Guidance:**

As you scroll, you'll find detailed guidance for each checklist item.

#### **I. The Hook & The Big Idea (Checklist Items 1.1 - 1.3)**

*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 1.1: Project Title / Product Name:**
    *   **Guidance:** Choose something memorable, relevant, and ideally, catchy. This is the first thing your audience sees.
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 1.2: Team Members & "The Ask" (Implicit):**
    *   **Guidance:** Briefly introduce your group members. Your "ask" isn't for funding, but for me (your instructor) to recognize your concept as well-researched, innovative, and viable within the scope of this course.
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 1.3: Elevator Pitch / Logline (Aim for ~30 seconds in presentation):**
    *   **Guidance:** Concisely answer:
        *   *What is your product/feature?*
        *   *Who is it for (target user)?*
        *   *What core problem does it solve?*
        *   *What's the key benefit or unique "magic" it offers?*
    *   *Example: "Our project, 'MoodMentor AI,' is an NLP-powered mental health companion app for university students. It uses sentiment analysis and conversational AI to provide personalized emotional support and early intervention suggestions, helping students manage stress and improve their wellbeing during critical academic periods."*

#### **II. The Problem & The Opportunity (Checklist Items 2.1 - 2.4)**

*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 2.1: Problem Statement:**
    *   **Guidance:** Clearly define the specific pain point or unmet need that your solution addresses. Why is this problem significant? Who feels this pain most acutely? Use relatable examples from any domain (healthcare, education, business, social good, etc.).
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 2.2: Target User / Customer Persona:**
    *   **Guidance:** Be specific! "Everyone" or "professionals" is too broad. Is it for "non-technical small business owners managing customer inquiries," "college students struggling with information overload," or "elderly individuals trying to stay connected with family"? Describe their relevant workflows, frustrations, and goals.
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 2.3: Market Opportunity (Simplified for Class):**
    *   **Guidance:** Briefly explain why this problem is worth solving. Is the target user base significant or growing? Why is *now* a good time for your NLP-driven solution (e.g., new NLP advancements, cloud accessibility, changing user behaviors, emerging needs)?
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 2.4: Existing Alternatives / Competition:**
    *   **Guidance:** How do your target users currently try to solve this problem (even if it's manual, inefficient, or with a different type of tool)? Are there any direct or indirect competitors? What are their key limitations that your solution overcomes? This sets up your unique value.

#### **III. Your Solution (Checklist Items 3.1 - 3.6)**

*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 3.1: Proposed Solution - Product/Feature Overview:**
    *   **Guidance:** Clearly describe your product or feature. What does it do at a high level? How does it directly solve the problem for your target user?
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 3.2: Core Value Proposition / Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**
    *   **Guidance:** What is the *single most compelling reason* a user would be excited about your solution? What's the "magic" or key innovation that makes it stand out?
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 3.3: Key Features & Functionality (Prioritized):**
    *   **Guidance:** List and briefly explain 3-5 core features. For each, clearly state the benefit to the user. Focus on features that deliver your USP and solve the core problem.
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 3.4: NLP / AI Core - The "How":**
    *   **Guidance:** This is CRITICAL for the course!
        *   What *specific* NLP techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, NER, text classification, summarization, embeddings, LLM prompting for generation/analysis, chatbots, translation) are central to your solution?
        *   How do these techniques enable your key features and deliver the value? Be specific (e.g., "We'll use named entity recognition to automatically extract key information from legal documents and create searchable summaries" rather than just "We use AI").
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 3.5: Cloud Integration (Conceptual):**
    *   **Guidance:** Briefly explain how cloud tools/services (e.g., serverless functions for NLP tasks, cloud storage for data/embeddings, managed AI/ML services like Google Vertex AI, AWS SageMaker, OpenAI API) would be leveraged. Why are these beneficial (scalability, cost, pre-trained models, etc.)?
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 3.6: User Experience (UX) - Mockups / Storyboards / User Flow:**
    *   **Guidance:** Since you're not building the full product, this is ESSENTIAL.
        *   Visually demonstrate how a user would interact with your product/feature. Include simple mockups, wireframes (tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or even clear hand-drawn sketches are fine), or a storyboard illustrating the core user journey.
        *   Focus on clarity and how the UX helps the user achieve their goal with your NLP-powered solution. HCI students, this is a great place for you to shine!

#### **IV. Impact & Feasibility (Checklist Items 4.1 - 4.3)**

*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 4.1: Potential Impact / Benefits:**
    *   **Guidance:** What are the tangible benefits for your target user and potentially society? (e.g., saves X hours per week, reduces costs by Y%, improves quality of life, enables better decision-making, increases accessibility, enhances learning outcomes).
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 4.2: Success Metrics / KPIs (Conceptual):**
    *   **Guidance:** If your product were real, how would you know it's successful? Think about 2-3 Key Performance Indicators (e.g., user adoption rate, task completion time, accuracy of NLP-driven suggestions, user satisfaction, problem resolution rate).
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 4.3: Technical Feasibility & Challenges (Briefly):**
    *   **Guidance:** Beyond the NLP/Cloud aspects, what are other key technical considerations? What are the biggest potential challenges or risks (e.g., acquiring or creating suitable training data for a custom NLP model, ensuring model fairness and avoiding bias, privacy and security concerns, integration with existing systems)? Acknowledging these shows critical thinking.

#### **V. The "Why" & Next Steps (Checklist Items 5.1 - 5.4)**

*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 5.1: "Why This Team?" / Passion & Skills (Brief):**
    *   **Guidance:** Why is your group passionate about this particular problem and solution? Briefly highlight any relevant skills or perspectives (especially linking MI and HCI strengths) that make your group well-suited to conceptualize this.
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 5.2: Future Vision / Potential Next Steps (Conceptual):**
    *   **Guidance:** If this were a real startup or project, what would be the logical next 1-2 steps (e.g., build a very basic prototype of one core feature, conduct detailed user interviews, explore partnerships)? What's the bigger vision if this idea grows?
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 5.3: Summary & Call to Action (Reiterate Value):**
    *   **Guidance:** Briefly recap the core problem, your innovative solution, and its main value proposition. End with a strong, memorable concluding statement.
*   `[ ]` **Checklist Item 5.4: Q&A Slide:**
    *   **Guidance:** A simple "Thank You & Questions?" slide for the end of your deck. (For the recorded presentation, you can just verbally signify the end).
