## Class 3 Outline & Pre-reading

This document outlines the topics for our third class meeting and provides recommended materials to review beforehand.

### Preview for Class 3 (Next Week's Date - e.g., Wednesday, May 14th, 2025)

Next week, we will embark on the exciting topic of **Text Classification**, a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing. You'll also get a gentle introduction to the broader concept of **Supervised Machine Learning**.

**Main Topics:**
* **Introduction to Text Classification:** Understanding how we can teach machines to categorize text. 
* **Sentiment Analysis:** A key application of classification â€“ determining if text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
* **Naive Bayes:** Our first classification algorithm for text.
* **Logistic Regression:** Another powerful algorithm for classification tasks. 

**Bridging the Gap - Essential Preprocessing Review:**
Before we can effectively classify text, it needs to be properly prepared. We'll revisit and build upon concepts from Chapters 2 & 3 of Jurafsky:
* **Tokenization:** Breaking text into words or sub-word units.
* **Normalization:** Standardizing text (e.g., lowercasing, stemming, lemmatization).
* **N-grams:** Sequences of N words, useful features for many NLP tasks.

We'll cover the practical aspects and work through examples in class.

## Class 3 Materials & Recording

* **Class 3 Slides:** [Link - *Placeholder, TBD*]
* **Full Recording:** [Link - *Placeholder, will be updated after class*]
* **Live Coding Examples (Python Notebook):** [Link - *Placeholder for Class 3 Live Coding Notebook*]

## Recommended Reading (Jurafsky & Martin, 3rd Edition)

For a comprehensive understanding, please refer to the "Speech and Language Processing" textbook:

**Core Reading for Class 3:**
* **Chapter 4: Naive Bayes and Sentiment**
* **Chapter 5: Logistic Regression**

**Review for Preprocessing Concepts (Important Foundation):**
* **Chapter 2: Regular Expressions, Text Normalization, Edit Distance** (Focus on sections relevant to preparing text for models)
* **Chapter 3: N-gram Language Models** (Understand how n-grams are formed and their utility as features)

## Recommended Python Libraries for Sentiment Analysis & Classification

Here are some useful Python libraries you can explore for implementing sentiment analysis and other text classification tasks. We're highlighting tools that range from simpler rule-based approaches to more comprehensive machine learning frameworks:

* **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner):**
    * A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool, particularly attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It's great for getting quick sentiment scores without needing to train a model.
    * GitHub: [https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)
* **Asent:**
    * A rule-based sentiment analysis library for Python that integrates with spaCy. It's inspired by VADER but offers a more modular ruleset and includes visualizers for interpreting results.
    * GitHub: [https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/asent](https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/asent)
* **LBSA (Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis):**
    * A library for lexicon-based sentiment analysis, inspired by the Syuzhet R package. It allows for sentiment scoring based on lexicons like the NRC Emotion Lexicon.
    * GitHub: [https://github.com/AntoinePassemiers/Lexicon-Based-Sentiment-Analysis](https://github.com/AntoinePassemiers/Lexicon-Based-Sentiment-Analysis)
* **Scikit-learn:**
    * A powerful and widely used library for machine learning in Python. While not exclusively for NLP, it provides many algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines) and utilities (e.g., TF-IDF vectorization, model evaluation tools) crucial for building custom text classification and sentiment analysis models from scratch. This is excellent for when you want to train your own models.
