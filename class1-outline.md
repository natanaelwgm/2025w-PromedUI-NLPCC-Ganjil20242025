# Class 1 Outline: Introduction to NLP & Cloud Tools

**(Goal: Understand foundational NLP tasks and how cloud platforms provide the tools & scale to implement them.)**

## I. Introduction & Course Framing

* **A. Welcome & Setting the Stage:** An NLP Journey with Cloud Tools
* **B. Why NLP Matters Today:** From Search to Generative AI
* **C. The Challenge of Real-World NLP:** Data, Scale, and Computation
* **D. The Cloud's Role:** Providing the Infrastructure & Services for Modern NLP
* **E. Contextualizing Foundational NLP in the Age of LLMs**
    * 1.  Acknowledging the Power of Large Language Models
    * 2.  The "Are Traditional Methods Obsolete?" Question
    * 3.  Why Understanding Foundations Still Matters (Feature Engineering, Evaluation, Task-Specific Models)
* **F. Our Course Approach:** Learning NLP Concepts, Applying with Cloud Tools

## II. What is NLP? A High-Level Overview

* **A. Defining Natural Language Processing**
* **B. Common NLP Tasks** (Briefly introduce: Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Translation, Summarization, Speech-to-Text, Q&A)
* **C. The NLP Pipeline** (Conceptual: Text Acquisition -> Preprocessing -> Feature Extraction -> Modeling -> Evaluation)

## III. Motivating Use Cases: NLP in Media Production (Enabled by the Cloud)

* **A. Use Case 1:** Auto-Transcription (Speech-to-Text) - *Introduces need for compute/APIs*
* **B. Use Case 2:** Bulk Subtitle Translation - *Highlights scale, network, managed services*
* **C. Use Case 3:** Sentiment & Keyword Analysis for Content - *Shows text analysis capabilities*
* **D. Connecting Use Cases to Cloud Needs:** Why cloud makes these feasible (Scalability, Pre-trained Models/APIs, Data Storage)

## IV. Essential Cloud Concepts for NLP Practitioners

* **A. The Core Needs:** Compute, Storage, Network
* **B. Accessing Cloud Power:** Service Models (SaaS, PaaS, Serverless, IaaS) - *Focus on how they relate to accessing NLP tools/infra*
    * 1.  Analogy & Trade-offs (Control vs. Convenience)
    * 2.  Examples relevant to NLP: Using a pre-built Translation API (SaaS/PaaS) vs. Training a model on a VM (IaaS/PaaS).
    * *(See Resources section below for a detailed intro reading on Cloud Concepts)*

## V. Live Demonstration: Cloud-Based NLP in Action

* **A. Task:** Cloud Speech-to-Text Service (e.g., via Web Console or simple API call)
* **B. Steps & Observation Points** (Input audio -> Processing -> Output text)
* **C. Connecting Demo to Concepts:** Identifying the NLP Task (STT) & the enabling Cloud elements (API as PaaS/SaaS, underlying Compute/Storage)

## VI. Activity: Identifying NLP Opportunities & Cloud Solutions in a Workflow

* **A. Task:** Analyze a Media Workflow (Personal or Hypothetical)
* **B. Process:**
    * 1.  Identify steps involving language/text/speech (Potential NLP Tasks).
    * 2.  Brainstorm specific NLP solutions (e.g., transcription, translation, summarization).
    * 3.  Consider *how* Cloud Services could implement/scale these NLP solutions (e.g., "Use Cloud STT API for transcription", "Store large video files in Cloud Storage").
* **C. Discussion & Q&A**

## VII. Wrap-up, Next Steps & Initial Setup

* **A. Key Takeaways Recap** (NLP Tasks, Cloud as Enabler)
* **B. Homework Assignment:** "First Cloud NLP Quest & Toolkit Setup"
    * 1.  Task: Sign up for Cloud Free Tier (Essential Tool)
    * 2.  Task: Replicate the Cloud Speech-to-Text Demo (Hands-on NLP Task)
    * 3.  Task: Reflection Post (Connect demo to NLP concepts & cloud role)
    * 4.  Task: Set Up Essential Tools (GitHub, LLM Access, NotebookLM/Colab)
* **C. Looking Ahead:** Preview of Class 2 (e.g., Deeper Dive into Text Preprocessing, First Coding Examples)
