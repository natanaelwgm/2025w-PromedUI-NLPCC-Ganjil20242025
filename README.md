# Cloud Computing Introduction Page

This repository contains the source files for a simple GitHub Pages site explaining the basics of cloud computing, based on the content in `index.md`.

## Deployment

This site is designed to be deployed using GitHub Pages.

1.  Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in the repository settings (Settings -> Pages).
2.  Set the source to "Deploy from a branch".
3.  Choose the `main` branch (or whichever branch these files are on) and the `/ (root)` folder.
4.  GitHub Actions will build and deploy the site using Jekyll and the theme specified in `_config.yml`.

The public website URL will be available in the Pages settings once deployed.
