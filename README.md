# NLP in Media Production with Cloud Tools (NLPCC UI 2025) - Course Materials

This repository hosts the official course materials for **NLP in Media Production with Cloud Tools (NLPCC)**, offered by the Program Vokasi Produksi Media Universitas Indonesia during the Ganjil semester of the 2024/2025 academic year.

## Course Overview

This practical course equips Human Computer Interaction and Media Intelligence students with the knowledge and skills to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cloud computing tools within media production workflows.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

*   **`index.md`**: The main course homepage built with Jekyll, containing the course description, instructor information, the full course outline, and links to assessment details.
*   **`classX-outline.md`**: Detailed outlines, pre-reading materials, links to slides/recordings, and assignment information for each class session (e.g., `class1-outline.md`, `class2-outline.md`).
*   **`classX-assignment.md`**: Specific instructions for weekly assignments (e.g., `class1-assignment.md`).
*   **`scoring-rubric.md`**: Explains the course assessment structure, grading components (participation, weekly tasks, final project), and the optional bonus system for public sharing.
*   **`nlpcc_*.ipynb` / `*.html`**: Contains code examples, live coding sessions notebooks (like `nlpcc_2025_week2_livecoding.ipynb`), or simple web tools (like `nlpcc2025-week2-regex-email-checker.html`) demonstrated in class.
*   **`class-materials/`**: (Currently seems empty or contains ignored files) Intended for supplementary readings or resources.
*   **Jekyll Files (`_config.yml`, `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `assets/`)**: Files related to the GitHub Pages website generation using the Jekyll framework.
*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files intentionally excluded from the repository (e.g., build outputs, caches, `.DS_Store`).
*   **`waranProfile.txt`**: Contains instructor profile information (Note: This file is listed in `.gitignore`).

## Weekly Materials

Course materials are added progressively:

*   **Week 1:** Introduction to NLP & Cloud, GitHub setup, LLM exploration (`class1-outline.md`, `class1-assignment.md`).
*   **Week 2:** Traditional Text Cleaning & Regex, Basic Entity Tagging (`class2-outline.md`, `nlpcc2025-week2-regex-email-checker.html`, `nlpcc_2025_week2_livecoding.ipynb`). Assignment details forthcoming.
*   *(Future weeks will cover topics like Classification, Semantic Representations, LLMs, Chatbots, Multi-Modal & Agentic Models)*

## Website & Deployment

This repository is also the source for the course website, deployed automatically using **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll**.

*   The public URL for the course website can typically be found in the repository settings under "Pages".
*   The site is built from the `main` branch.

## Contributing / Using These Materials

While primarily for enrolled students, feel free to explore the public materials. Students are expected to set up their own `nlpcc-ui-2025` repository for assignments as detailed in `class1-assignment.md`.
