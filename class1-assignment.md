# Class 1 Assignment: Your First (?) GitHub Contribution & LLM Exploration

Welcome to your first assignment! The goal of this task is to get you comfortable with two essential tools we'll be using throughout the course: **GitHub** for version control and collaboration, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like Google Gemini for creative coding and problem-solving.

This assignment is designed to be open-ended. The minimum requirements are straightforward, but we encourage you to explore and create something that genuinely interests you!

---

## Task 1: Create Your Class Repository on GitHub

Your first task is to set up your personal repository for this class on GitHub. This will be your space to store code, track your progress, and eventually collaborate.

1.  **Create a New Repository:**
    *   Go to your GitHub account.
    *   Create a new **public** repository.
    *   Name the repository exactly: `nlpcc-ui-2025`.
    *   You can initialize it with a README file.

2.  **Add Initial Content:**
    *   Clone the repository to your local machine (or use GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Desktop, etc.).
    *   Create or edit the `README.md` file. At a minimum, add a sentence like: "This is my repository for the NLP & Cloud Computing class at UI (2025)."
    *   Feel free to make the README more elaborate if you wish! You could add sections about yourself, your goals for the class, or anything else relevant.
    *   Add the `README.md` file to Git staging (`git add README.md`).
    *   Commit your changes with a descriptive message (`git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README"`).
    *   Push your changes to GitHub (`git push origin main` or `git push origin master`, depending on your default branch name).

**Goal:** The main objective here is to ensure you can successfully create a repository, make changes locally, commit those changes, and push them to GitHub. We need to see evidence of a commit and push.

## Task 2: Add an LLM-Generated Notebook

Your second task involves experimenting with an LLM and adding the result to your new repository.

1.  **Create with an LLM:**
    *   Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to help you create *something* in a Python notebook (`.ipynb` format).
    *   We highly encourage you to use **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**, which has been made available for this class. However, you can use other LLMs if you prefer.
    *   What should you create? It's completely up to you! It can be:
        *   As simple as a notebook that just prints "Hello World!".
        *   Something slightly more complex, like generating code for a basic calculator (similar to the Canvas/Gemini example shown in class).
        *   Any other piece of code, analysis, or creative text generation that interests you. The key is to use the LLM as a tool in the creation process.

2.  **Save and Add to Repo:**
    *   Save your creation as a Python notebook file (e.g., `my_llm_creation.ipynb`). You can create this using Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or any other environment that supports `.ipynb` files.
    *   Place this `.ipynb` file inside your `nlpcc-ui-2025` repository directory on your local machine.
    *   Add the notebook file to Git staging (`git add your_notebook_name.ipynb`).
    *   Commit the new file (`git commit -m "Add LLM-generated notebook"`).
    *   Push this commit to GitHub (`git push origin main` or `git push origin master`).
    *   Ensure the above steps work (if not, debug with LLM!)

**Goal:** This task encourages you to start playing with LLMs as development tools and practice adding different file types to your Git repository. We want to see your experimentation, no matter how simple or complex.

## Deadline and Submission

*   **Deadline:** Tuesday, April 29th, 2025, at 23:55 PM Jakarta Time (WIB).
*   **Submission Method:** Regardless of whether you choose to share publicly or keep your work private, you **must** notify the instructors via email by the deadline for your assignment to be counted.
*   **Email Contents:**
    *   Send an email to **both** `natanael.waraney@ui.ac.id` and `natanaelmassie2009@gmail.com`.
    *   The subject line should be: `[NLPCC-UI 2025] Class 1 Assignment - Your Name - Student Number`.
    *   The email body **must** contain a direct link to your `nlpcc-ui-2025` GitHub repository.
    *   If you are aiming for the public sharing bonus (see below), also include a direct link to your public post (LinkedIn, blog, etc.) in the same email.
*   **Important:** Submissions will only be graded if the notification email is received by the deadline. Work pushed to GitHub or posted publicly without the corresponding email notification will **not** be counted.

## Optional: Public Sharing (Bonus Opportunity)

As outlined in the `scoring-rubric.md`, you have the opportunity to earn bonus points by making your work public. For this first assignment, this means sharing your newly created `nlpcc-ui-2025` repository and your LLM-generated notebook.

*   **How to Share:** You can share this publicly in any way you prefer! Consider platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium, a personal blog, or any other social media channel where you build your professional presence.
*   **What Counts:** To qualify for the bonus, you need to create an actual public post, article, or share about your repository/work. **Simply having your GitHub repository set to public is NOT sufficient for the bonus points.** The goal is active sharing and engagement.
*   **What to Share:** Create a brief post introducing your repository for the class. You could mention what you learned, what you included in your notebook, or your excitement for the course. Feel free to keep it simple, for example: "Excited to start my NLP & Cloud Computing journey! Here's my course repo where I'll be sharing my progress: [link to your repo] #NLPCourse #GitHub #AI" or like super long LinkedIn flex-type of posts (adjust to yall' taste). Heck, you can even create your own YouTube video showing your process, "day in my life as NLP CC student" content, etc. As long as it's public -- whatever the form -- and you share the link with me, it counts!
*   **Polishing Your Post (Recommended):** Consider using an LLM (like Gemini!) to help you draft or refine your public post. Making it polished is great practice for personal branding.
*   **Notify the Instructor:** To ensure your public work is acknowledged for potential bonus points, please include **a direct link to your public post** in the submission email sent to `natanael.waraney@ui.ac.id` and `natanaelmassie2009@gmail.com`, alongside the link to your GitHub repository.

This is entirely optional, but a great way to start building your public portfolio and automatically boost your score.

That's it for the first assignment. Focus on understanding the workflow of GitHub and having some initial fun with an LLM. Don't worry about perfection; the process is the primary learning objective here.
